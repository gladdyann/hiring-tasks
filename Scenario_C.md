Dear Anne,

Thank you for reaching out, and I truly understand how frustrating it must be to miss the deadline, especially given your current situation. It’s clear that you're highly motivated and have been working hard in your internship search, and I can only imagine how disheartening it must feel to not have received an offer yet.

Unfortunately, the deadline for this year’s program has passed, and the Summer Interview Prep course is currently full with a long waitlist. We deeply regret that we cannot accommodate you this time, especially knowing that this would have been your last chance to join before graduating.

We absolutely want to support your efforts, though, so I’d be happy to share our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view), which contains tips and guidelines that could be really useful as you continue applying to internships. You can also explore our resources page for more tools that might help in your preparation.

Additionally, we also encourage you to sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst), so we can keep you updated on future courses, virtual events, or other opportunities that may be relevant to you.

We understand how disheartening this process can be, but your determination is inspiring, and we’re confident that your hard work will pay off. If there’s anything else we can assist with, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Wishing you the best of luck with your job search and future endeavors.

Warm regards,
CodePath.org Team
