Hello Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to do what it takes to make up for the missed coursework. We value your commitment to the course, and I want to acknowledge that you’ve put in the effort to get back on track.

As part of our [course policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/and101/policy), consistent participation and timely submission of coursework are essential for ensuring that all students stay on track and get the most out of the program. We did reach out for feedback on why the assignments weren't submitted, but unfortunately, we didn’t hear back from you before proceeding with the withdrawal.

While we cannot reinstate you into the live course at this point due to our policy, I want to emphasize that you still have lifetime access to the TIP101 course materials through the GitHub account you used to sign up. This gives you the flexibility to continue learning at your own pace, which I hope will help you complete the course.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need support as you continue your learning journey.

We admire your willingness to take responsibility and remain committed to helping you succeed.


All the best,
CodePath.org Team
