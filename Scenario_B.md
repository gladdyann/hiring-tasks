Hi Jane,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns. We truly appreciate the effort, time, and dedication you put into completing the Flix App and the application process. It's clear that you are highly motivated to learn and grow, and we admire your commitment.

We understand how disappointing it must feel to learn about the eligibility requirements after putting in so much work. Our application process does include information about eligibility, but we recognize that it may not always be as clear as it could be. Your feedback is invaluable, and we will explore ways to make these details more prominent in the future.

At CodePath, we currently have sponsorships and partnerships that limit our courses to students who are enrolled at universities in the United States. While we have run classes in Haiti currently and Taiwan in the past, we are not yet able to offer courses outside of the U.S. at this time.

We understand your strong interest in the course and your frequent visits to the U.S. but as a non-profit organization with specific sponsorship guidelines, we are unable to make exceptions to these eligibility requirements. We really appreciate your understanding and hope that we might have the opportunity to serve students from Thailand in the future as we continue to grow.

Once again, we sincerely appreciate the hard work you put into your application and apologize for any frustration this has caused. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any additional questions or would like to explore alternative learning opportunities.


Best regards,
CodePath.org Team
