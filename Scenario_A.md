Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in the Advanced track. We truly appreciate your enthusiasm and the impressive achievements you've made as a sophomore at MITâ€”it's clear you're a highly capable student!

Our placement process is designed to ensure each student has the best possible learning experience. Based on your pre-work score, we've determined that the Intermediate track is the most suitable fit for your current level of technical interview skills.

While the Intermediate and Advanced tracks cover similar foundational topics, the pacing and depth of the Advanced track are tailored for students who have already demonstrated mastery of the pre-work content. Placing students in the appropriate track helps us ensure that everyone can effectively engage with the material and make meaningful process.

We want to make sure you're set up for success, and we believe the Intermediate track will provide you with the right level of challenge and support.

Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to having you in the program!

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
